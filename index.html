    <h4>Welcome to my <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript">CS50W</a> Project0! </h4>
    					<p>For this project, I have taken it upon myself to try to provide multiple ideas and examples of how each and every one of us can use these uncertain circumstances as a learning opportunity, and come out of this quarantine as more well-rounded individuals.</p>
              <p>In the  <a href="recipes.html">recipes</a> page, you will find some fun recipes to try at home, either by yourself or with your loved ones.</p>
              <p>The <a href="entertainment.html">entertainment</a> page contains various streamable shows, movies, etc. to watch during this downtime. </p>
              <p>The <a href="books.html">books</a> page will show some excellent self-development books that we can read and learn from.</p>
              <p>  Finally, the <a href="exercises.html">exercises</a> page will list a few activities that we can use to stay in shape and work on our internal and external wellbeing.
